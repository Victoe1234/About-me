<h1>All About Me</h1>
<p>One of my hobbies is being active. I love to play sports to let my competitive side show. The sports I have played so far are football, soccer and track and feild. I want to do more activites like a marathon or join other sports like volleyball or baseball. I also like to go on runs or if possible go swimming at the beach or pool. </p>
<p>Another one of my hobbies is playing video games. I play Fortnite, Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Mario RPGs. I also play Pokemon and Fire Emblem. I spend most of my weekends playing Fortnite with my friends trying to get my first win. I have a Wii U and the orignal X-box and play video games any time I feel like it.</p>
